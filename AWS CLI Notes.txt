USING COMMAND LINE FOR AWS:

3. Access the bucket 

aws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://cellpainting-gallery/cpg0016-jump/

** using ls will show you all available paths that are within that folder.
** for example, using the above line will give you a list of sources
**We will use Hannah's metadata code to find the path that we need

**switch ls-->cp to download, and then type the file that you want to get onto your local device

aws s3 cp --no-sign-request s3://cellpainting-gallery/cpg0016-jump/source_1/workspace/profiles/Batch1_20221004/UL000109/UL000109.parquet UL000109.parquet

**the above code will download UL000109.parquet to the path that you're currently in 
** in my case this path is "C:\Users\Sepro" or whatever's next the lines you type on

**to move to a specific path (ex: a folder called "parquet dowloads") you can use "cd":

(base) C:\Users\Sepro>cd "parquet download"

(base) c:\Users\Sepro\parquet download>

**you can then run your commands and anything you download will go into that folder
